# Introduction
I have a long history of starting and finishing projects throughout my 30+ years of software development experience.  I have demonstrated to all of my employers an aptitude for gathering requirements, turning them into technical specifications and realizing those requirements through development, testing, packaging and/or deployment.

I have very strong object-oriented development skills, experience with application design patterns and enterprise integration patterns.  I have implemented these patterns in various programming languages including C/C++, C#, Java, Kotlin and PHP.

I have worked with numerous relational database management systems including Microsoft SQL, Oracle and MySQL.  I'm familiar with writing stored procedures, creating normalized schemas and enforcing referential integrity using foreign key constraints, triggers, etc.
